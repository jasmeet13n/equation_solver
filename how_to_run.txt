The how to run part of the section is very easy, because its python.
1) Make sure you are running a UNIX machine, otherwise the printing of expressions doesn’t work correctly due to unknown reasons.
2) Go to the code directory and type the command “python solver.py” in a terminal window. (requires python to be installed on the computer)
3) You will be asked to input an equation and then a variable
4) Just make sure you enter valid syntax, or the program will fail before searching anything.
5) The program will give 2 outputs, first a correct solution, but not simplified. Next its simplified version. 

"The Simplify stage will take 5 - 10 seconds, so try to be patient."
